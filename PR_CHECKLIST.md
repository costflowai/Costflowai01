# Pull Request: Refactor to Spec - Calculators Fixed, Security/Perf/A11y/SEO Hardened

## 🎯 Summary
Complete refactor of CostFlowAI to meet specification requirements. All calculators now compute only on explicit button clicks, with proper validation, exports, and comprehensive hardening.

## 📋 Specification Checklist

### Layout & Structure
- ✅ `/assets/css/{main.css,estimator-widget.css}` - Created and organized
- ✅ `/assets/js/{calculators.js,calculators-hub.js,export-utilities.js,validators.js}` - Implemented
- ✅ `/calculators/index.html` - Canonical calculator page
- ✅ `calculator-inventory.json` - Complete calculator registry
- ✅ Test files in `/test/` directory
- ✅ Netlify edge functions for CSP nonce

### Routing
- ✅ Canonical: `/calculators#<slug>` routing implemented
- ✅ `/calculators/<slug>` → 200! rewrites configured
- ✅ `_redirects` file with proper rules
- ✅ Remove `.html` extensions (301 redirects)

### Calculator Framework
- ✅ Manual-only computation (`CALC_TRIGGER_MODE='manual_all'`)
- ✅ Global event gate preventing auto-compute
- ✅ `requestCompute()` only accepts `origin='manual'`
- ✅ Calculate button with `data-action="calculate"`
- ✅ `window.lastCalculation` tracking
- ✅ `window.lastCalculationByType[slug]` storage

### Validators
- ✅ Type/range validation
- ✅ Feet-inches parsing
- ✅ Locale-aware number formatting
- ✅ Calculate button disabled until valid
- ✅ Inline error messages

### Export Utilities
- ✅ CSV export with timestamp
- ✅ Print functionality
- ✅ Copy to clipboard
- ✅ Email via mailto with JSON

### Calculator Math
- ✅ Concrete volume calculator (cubic yards, bags, cost)
- ✅ Paint coverage calculator (gallons, area, cost)
- ✅ Drywall calculator (sheets, compound, cost)
- ✅ Framing calculator (studs, board feet, cost)
- ✅ Transparent formulas with unit conversions

### Accessibility & SEO
- ✅ Proper semantic HTML structure
- ✅ ARIA labels and roles
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ `<link rel="canonical">` tags
- ✅ `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`
- ✅ Structured data for search

### Security
- ✅ CSP with nonce injection via Netlify Edge
- ✅ Security headers (X-Frame-Options, etc)
- ✅ Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- ✅ Permissions-Policy restrictive
- ✅ Input sanitization

### Performance
- ✅ All JS with defer at end of `<body>`
- ✅ Service worker for caching
- ✅ Resource hints (preconnect, preload)
- ✅ Budget constraints defined

### PWA
- ✅ `manifest.json` with icons and start_url
- ✅ `sw.js` with skipWaiting and claim
- ✅ Cache strategy (network-first for HTML)
- ✅ Service worker registration

### CI/QA
- ✅ `test/smoke.mjs` - No auto-compute verification
- ✅ `test/link-check.mjs` - Zero broken links
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI workflow
- ✅ Lighthouse CI with thresholds (Perf≥90, A11y≥95)

## 🔄 Breaking Changes
1. **No Auto-Compute**: Calculators no longer compute on input change
2. **Manual Only**: All calculations require explicit button click
3. **New Routes**: Calculator URLs changed to `/calculators#<slug>`

## ✨ New Features
- Input validation with inline errors
- Export to CSV, print, email
- PWA with offline support
- CSP with nonce injection
- Comprehensive test suite

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Local Testing
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run smoke tests
npm test

# Check for broken links
npm run test:links

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Run Lighthouse
npm run lighthouse
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Calculate button only enabled when inputs valid
- [ ] Results appear after clicking Calculate
- [ ] Export/Print/Email functions work
- [ ] Service worker installs and controls page
- [ ] No console errors in production
