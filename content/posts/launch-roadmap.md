## Why calculator-first matters

We built CostFlowAI to solve the slow, opaque estimating workflows that frustrate preconstruction teams. Calculators let us lead with math, explain every assumption, and export cleanly.

## What ships first

1. Concrete Slab Pro for structural concrete ROMs.
2. A reusable calculator engine with explain/export parity.
3. Searchable insights that benchmark best-in-class estimates.

Stay tuned for weekly releases as we expand the trade library.
