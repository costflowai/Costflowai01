  - Proper fallback handling for browsers without canShare()
  - Improved cross-browser compatibility

### Performance Optimizations Implemented

#### Loading Performance
- Added script defer/async attributes for optimal loading
- Implemented resource hints (preconnect, preload)
- Created lazy loading for images below the fold
- Optimized critical rendering path

#### Runtime Performance
- Created performance optimizer module
- Implemented requestIdleCallback for non-critical tasks
- Added intersection observer for animations
- Optimized scroll event handling with RAF

#### Build Optimizations

   - Timer cleanup

### Deployment Details

- **Git Commit**: 486c777
- **Build Version**: 1.0.0
- **Build Number**: 74e35954
- **Deployment Platform**: Netlify
- **Automatic Deployment**: Triggered by GitHub push

### Files Modified
- 31 JavaScript files updated
- 1 HTML file optimized
- 3 new utility modules created
- Security headers configured

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Security Testing**
   - Verify XSS fixes in material waste optimizer
   - Test CSP headers in production
   - Check for console logs in production

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Run Lighthouse audit
   - Check Core Web Vitals
   - Test lazy loading functionality
   - Verify cache headers

3. **Functionality Testing**
   - Test share functionality across browsers
   - Verify calculator operations
   - Check mobile responsiveness
   - Test error handling

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

Monitor these metrics after deployment:
- Page load time
- JavaScript error rate
- Memory usage patterns
- User engagement metrics
- Core Web Vitals scores

### Next Steps

1. Monitor Netlify deployment status
2. Run post-deployment tests
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify performance improvements
5. Monitor user feedback

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert to previous commit: `git revert 486c777`
2. Push to trigger new deployment
3. Or use Netlify's instant rollback feature
